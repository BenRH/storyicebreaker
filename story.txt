STORY:

Once upon a time there was a good hund.
And that Hund had just eaten some Lederhose.
And he loved eating Gebaeck.
After eating, the hund went to Berlin.
In Berlin, he saw a big crowd at a beautiful Biergarten and trotted in.
The hund would have stayed outside with the lively crowd however it was quite a hot day and he was in dire need of some klimaanlage.
